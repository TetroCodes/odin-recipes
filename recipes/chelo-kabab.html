    <p>Chelo kabab (chelow kabob or chelo kebab), literally means white rice with kebab. The particular variant of meat kabob that this recipe presents is called koobideh (kubideh), a ground beef kebab. This preparation is usually considered one of Iran, and also Turkey, national dishes.</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>Koobideh</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Dilute saffron in Â½ cup of boiling water, cover and infuse for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the ground meat with the grated onion, then add the spices, salt and pepper. Stir for 2 minutes after each ingredient is added.</li>
        <li>Finish with 3 tablespoons of infused saffron water and mix well again.</li>
        <li>Place in a covered container in the fridge for at least 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Make 8 koobideh kebabs by pressing the meat well to barbecue skewers.</li>
        <li>Pinch the meat with your fingers regularly throughout the skewer every inch to give its characteristic shape.</li>
        <li>Grill the skewers on a BBQ by placing them over the coals. Turn them regularly to ensure a perfectly even grilling for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the tomatoes and onions on the BBQ and turn regularly. They are served as an accompaniment to the skewers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Chelo<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the rice in plenty of cold water for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse thoroughly and drain.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice for 7 minutes in large amount of salted boiling water.</li>
        <li>Drain the rice, but do not wash the pot.</li>
        <li>Keep over high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil and 2 tablespoons tablespoons water, stir and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour the precooked and drained rice to form a pyramid.</li>
        <li>Poke 3 to 4 holes in the rice with the handle of your wooden spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of oil in an evenly distributed fashion.
        </li>
        <li>Put a dish towel over pot, then cover with pot lid and bring dish towel ends over pot lid.</li>
        <li>This technique ensures a better seal, and is key to success of this type of rice steaming.</li>
        <li>Never open the lid throughout cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook over high heat about 5 to 10 minutes, until a little steam escapes from the sides of the lid.</li>
        <li>Then lower heat and cook for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the rice in a serving dish and remove the crispy rice crust that formed at the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the saffron in 2 tablespoons of boiling water, take a part of the cooked rice and pour the saffron on top.</li>
        <li>Serve the kebabs accompanied with the grilled tomatoes and onions and the rice topped with a few tablespoons of saffron rice.</li>
